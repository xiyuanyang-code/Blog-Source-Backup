# Welcome To My Blog! üëãüëãüëã  

**Version 2** (Last Updated Time: `2025/05/09`).

For the Chinese version, please visit [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](https://xiyuanyang-code.github.io/posts/Above-All-ZH/).  

## Introduction  

This section shares the same content as the [Intro](https://xiyuanyang-code.github.io/above/) page, providing an overview of the blog's purpose, goals, and themes. Feel free to jump there for details.  

## Before The Blog  

Three months ago, I stumbled upon **Lilian Weng**[^1], the former VP of Research at OpenAI and a leading expert in GPT model safety. She formulated the famous **Agent Recipe: Agent = LLM + Memory + Planning Skills + Tool Use**.  

In OpenAI's exclusive interview with her, [The Power of Continuous Learning](https://openai.com/index/the-power-of-continuous-learning/)[^3], she said:  

> "I believe in the power of learning, and it is never too late to learn. Maintaining my personal blog[^2] is a good way to keep this curiosity going and learn about new progress in the deep learning community regularly. I also encourage my team to keep on learning, whether related or unrelated to their current projects. Ideas in different topics or fields can often inspire new ideas and broaden the potential solution space.  
>
> I‚Äôm also a strong believer in teamwork. If everyone shines in their best strength, we will get 1+1 > 2. Meanwhile, we might often run into 'dirty' work, and personally, I‚Äôm very willing to take on those tasks because, as long as that‚Äôs the biggest blocker or that task can add the biggest value to the project, nothing should be considered 'dirty' or 'trivial.' I encourage people around me to do the same‚Äîbeing a team player and working together to expedite team productivity."

This philosophy aligns perfectly with the **Feynman Technique**:  

> 1. **Identify the subject.** Write down everything you know about the topic.  
> 2. **Teach it to a child.** If you can explain a concept simply, you truly understand it.  
> 3. **Identify knowledge gaps.** This is where real learning happens.  
> 4. **Organize, simplify, and tell a story.** Structure your explanation clearly.  

At the time, I had just entered university three months prior. Haunted by the remnants of high school‚Äôs exam-oriented mindset, I struggled to adapt to the vastness of knowledge in computer science. Without the rigid framework of standardized tests, how could I truly consolidate what I was learning?  

**Perhaps the answer was already before me.**

Whether through problem-solving, writing, or the Feynman Technique, the essence of learning lies in **reinforcing knowledge through output**. When you can fluently derive multiple proofs for a math problem, organize complex ideas into logical frameworks, or craft a blog post that enlightens others, you achieve **effective intellectual output**. This process not only solidifies understanding but also brings immense satisfaction.  

Yet, writing‚Äîespecially high-quality blog posts‚Äîis far more than mere typing.  

Think back to writing argumentative essays in high school. Did you ever feel that frustrating disconnect between **what you thought ‚â† what you planned ‚â† what you wrote ‚â† what you truly meant to express**? Often, what we call "inspiration" is just fragmented thoughts‚Äîfar from a well-structured, insightful, and innovative article.  

This is the real challenge of blogging‚Äîand its greatest value. **How do we refine fleeting sparks of inspiration into polished prose? How do we balance logic and expertise to produce clear, compelling writing?**
